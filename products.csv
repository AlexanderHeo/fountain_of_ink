The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. It has a translucent smoke grey cap, grip section, and piston knob. It is complemented by elegant rose gold trim, a rose gold-plated steel nib, and is presented in a modern clear display case. The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI''s goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI''s belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.', 'pen'),
