It has a built-in slide piston mechanism for use with bottled ink. The Neponset is a glimpse back in time to an era of legacies and war heroes. The New England Airship company, later renamed the Dartmouth Airship Co., the first of its kind in the United States, had a new CEO during a challenging time for our country. During the year of 1929 Nathan’s grandfather became CEO and one year later christened a new airship named the Neponset. The shape of the Neponset pen is similar to the dirigible and is constructed of the original fountain pen material ebonite, which was vulcanized in 1844 by Charles Goodyear in Massachusetts whose company built the Neponset airship. The Neponset is fitted with a three tined music nib, the "Vishnu Victory" nib in honor of the 2.5 million World War II allied soldiers of India as well as the reference to the source for the ebonite used in the pen and the original Neponset Blimp.', 'pen'),

The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. It has a translucent smoke grey cap, grip section, and piston knob. It is complemented by elegant rose gold trim, a rose gold-plated steel nib, and is presented in a modern clear display case. The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI''s goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI''s belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.', 'pen'),

"Manyosyu" - Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves - is the oldest (c.759) and most revered anthology of Japan's poetic compilations. Over a period of four centuries, 4,516 poems were written by every class of person ranging from Emperors to merchants and farmers. "Manyo" is an abbreviation of "Manyosyu" and its meaning indicates people of all ranks. "Manyosyu" is often regarded in Japan as a true expression of the Japanese spirit. The themes of the poems relate to love, elegies, nature, the seasons, and so on. Flowers are especially relevant in Japanese culture and about 1,500 of the poems in "Manyosyu" cover some 160 species of plants and 50 different flowers.', 'ink')
